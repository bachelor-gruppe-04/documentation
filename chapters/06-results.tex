\section{Machine Learning Model}

As described in Section~\ref{subsec:model-testing}, the model was evaluated using 100 games. Table~\ref{tab:accuracy-total} presents the overall move detection accuracy, both in total and broken down by piece type and color. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 90.6\%, successfully detecting 936 out of 1033 moves. Pawns had the highest detection rates, with over 98\% accuracy for both colors. In contrast, the model struggled particularly with black rooks with only 23.8\% accuracy.

Table~\ref{tab:board-type-accuracy} compares the success rates between the two physical board types used during testing. The wooden board slightly outperformed the plastic board, with a 91.2\% success rate compared to 89.9\%. This marginal difference may indicate a slightly more stable detection environment on the wooden surface. \\

Figure~\ref{fig:move-failures} shows the number of failed games (i.e., games where detection failed) grouped by the move number at which failure occurred. Bars are color-coded by board type. The majority of failures occurred within the first five moves, particularly at moves 2, 4, and 5. This trend suggests that the early game presents the greatest challenge for detection, potentially due to rapid development or ambiguity in piece positions. Notably, failures after move 9 were rare. \\

Table~\ref{tab:different-errors} categorizes the types of detection failures for each board type. The majority of failures were due to a complete lack of detection within the allotted time window. Incorrect detections (the model detecting a move but interpreting it wrongly) were less frequent but more common on the wooden board, accounting for 8 out of 48 failures, compared to just 1 on the plastic board.  \\

\section{Overview of Delivered Product}
The delivered product refers to the final version of the application submitted at the conclusion of this Bachelorâ€™s thesis. The application was developed at the request of the product owner and based on the requirements provided. The initial description served as a general concept rather than a detailed specification, which meant that decisions regarding design, architecture, and technology were left to the development team. Throughout the development process, ideas and design choices were discussed with the product owner and approved during regular meetings. \\

The application was developed as an open-source project with the intention that the code can be reused, maintained, and extended by others. All components are built using open and freely available technologies, ensuring that the system can be installed on local hardware without the need for licensed software or cloud-based services. This aligns with the requirement that all processing should be performed locally, using common hardware such as a webcam connected to a local machine running either Windows or Ubuntu. \\

The project follows clear coding standards and development best practices, making the code easy to understand and modify. All functionality is well documented, enabling future developers to build upon the existing solution. For example, to support new chess variants, integrate additional hardware, or improve the recognition models. To support future development and accessibility, the source code is published in a public Git repository without restrictions on reuse or adaptation. \\

The application itself is a local, camera-based system for digitalizing over-the-board chess games in real time. It detects piece movements on a physical chessboard using image recognition and converts the game into a PGN file, which can be viewed or analyzed digitally. The system operates entirely on local hardware, with a front-end interface that allows users to follow games live and a back-end that manages board recognition and game logic. The application is designed to be low-cost, open-source, and easy to maintain, with extensibility in mind for future features.

\section{Functional Results}
The application consists of three main components: machine learning, WebSocket communication, and the front-end interface. The back-end handles image recognition and game logic, using a machine learning model to detect board states. It communicates with the front-end through a WebSocket connection. The front-end is responsible for presenting this information to the user in real time. The cameras is connected with a USB-hub, where multiple cameras can be attached to the same computer. 

\subsection{API}
To enable real-time updates and improve the responsiveness of the front-end interface, the application uses a WebSocket connection between the back-end and the front-end. This method was suggested by the product owner and was also approved by the supervisor. This communication channel is used for transmitting move data as it is detected by the board recognition system. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which operate on a request-response basis, WebSocket allows for continuous, two-way communication between the server and the client. \\

Once the application initiates a connection, the WebSocket remains open throughout the session. As new moves are identified on the physical board, the back-end sends the corresponding move data as messages through the WebSocket. These messages are then received by the front-end, which updates the displayed move list and board state in real time. This provides a seamless viewing experience for users following live games. \\

The WebSocket server also handles specific command messages. For example, when the server sends a message labeled "RESET," the front-end clears the current move list, typically indicating the start of a new game. A message labeled "INVALID" is used to signal an unrecognized or incorrect move and does not trigger any front-end changes. All other messages are assumed to be valid algebraic notation representing chess moves and are appended to the game history displayed to the user. \\

The WebSocket functionality is encapsulated in a custom React hook on the front-end, which manages the connection lifecycle and state updates. This abstraction simplifies integration into the user interface and ensures that resources are properly cleaned up when the component is unmounted. Overall, the use of WebSocket communication is a key component in delivering a responsive and live experience, particularly for tournaments and public displays where move-by-move tracking is essential.

\subsection{Frontend}
The front-end of the application serves as the user interface. It includes a control panel for tournament organizers and a web application for spectators. The application's main responsibility is to visualize the chessboard and display ongoing moves. The front-end communicates with the back-end via WebSocket to ensure real-time updates and interactivity. \\

The control panel is a standalone administrative interface used exclusively by tournament organizers to configure and manage the tournament setup. Accessible only from the host computer, it allows the organizer to select the number of camera inputs, initiate the tournament, and reset boards between rounds, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:control-panel}. This interface ensures the secure and centralized management of tournament operations. \\

\begin{figure}[h!] \centering \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/results/frontend/control-panel/control-panel.png} \caption[Control panel for tournament organizers]{The control panel used by the tournament organizers.}\label{fig:control-panel} \end{figure}

Once the application is launched, the accompanying web application becomes accessible to spectators. It is designed to allow viewers to follow the tournament in real time across a range of devices. Built as a responsive interface, it adapts to both desktop and mobile screens to ensure accessibility and usability. Spectators can navigate between views, observe live games, and explore additional information about the system. \\

One of the main pages in the web application is the Tournament View, which presents an overview of all ongoing games. Each entry shows the board number, the players' names and ratings, and a link to follow the game live, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tournament-view-mocked}. The content is updated continuously, providing spectators with a live snapshot of the tournament's progress. \\

Another page is the Board View, which focuses on a single game in greater detail. This view includes a digital chessboard, a list of moves played, a live camera feed, and a visual evaluation bar, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:board-view-mocked}. The elements update in real time, creating an engaging and intuitive experience for users following a particular match. \\

In addition, the web application features a Game Preview page that displays simplified mini-boards for multiple games. This view enables users to quickly glance through active games and select one to view in detail, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:game-preview}. It offers a compact and efficient way to stay updated on several games at once. \\

\section{Project Management}
\label{sec:results-project-management}

To support iterative development and maintain a steady delivery pace, the project was organized using the Scrum framework, as described in Section~\ref{sec:project-management}. This structure enabled clear task distribution, regular feedback loops, and continuous improvement throughout the development process. \\

The implementation followed a bi-weekly sprint model. At the beginning of each sprint, sprint goals were defined and relevant items were selected from the Product Backlog, which was maintained using GitHubâ€™s built-in Issue Board. Tasks were categorized using predefined labels such as Feature, Enhancement, Documentation, and Bug, helping to clarify the nature and priority of each issue. The board was divided into columns: No Status, To Do, In Progress, and Done, providing a visual representation of the workflow. \\

Each sprint concluded with a Sprint Review, where completed features and updates were evaluated. This was followed by a Sprint Retrospective, during which challenges, bottlenecks, and team dynamics were discussed to identify areas of improvement for the next iteration. \\

The version control strategy supported the agile workflow by utilizing feature branches and pull requests. Each issue was implemented in its own branch, and changes were submitted via pull requests to the main branch. This made it possible to conduct structured code reviews, ensuring that the quality of the implementation met agreed standards before merging. \\

\subsection{Architecture Overview}
\label{subsec:diagrams}

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the system architecture and interaction flow, several \gls{uml} diagrams were created. These diagrams model different aspects of the live chess game digitization system, from component interactions and activity flow to user roles and use cases.

\subsubsection*{Sequence Diagram}
\label{subsubsec:sequence-diagram}

The sequence diagram, shown in Figure \ref{fig:sequence}, illustrates the chronological flow of interactions between the system components and external actors. It begins with the Admin initiating the game recording by setting up the camera, which captures and streams the board state to a local processing unit. This unit continuously detects and validates moves, updating the user interface accordingly. Users, from remote devices, can spectate the game in real time or save it as a \gls{pgn} file. The diagram emphasizes the communication between hardware (camera and local machine) and the \gls{ui}, highlighting how physical chess games are digitized and broadcasted.

\subsubsection*{Use-Case Diagram}
\label{subsubsec:use-case-diagram}

The use-case diagram, shown in Figure \ref{fig:use-case}, identifies the systemâ€™s main actors and the primary functionalities they interact with. Admins are responsible for hardware setup and initiating the game recording process. The system autonomously handles move detection, validation, and \gls{ui} updates. Users, on the other hand, access the game remotely to spectate or download \gls{pgn} files. This diagram provides a clear overview of who interacts with the system and what capabilities are exposed, forming the basis for understanding system requirements and user expectations.

        The activity diagram, shown in Figure \ref{fig:activity}, provides a high-level overview of the operational workflow during a chess game session. It models the continuous loop of capturing board states, detecting and validating moves, and updating the game state until the game ends. If a move is invalid, the system flags it but does not terminate the session. Once the game concludes, it is converted into a standard \gls{pgn} format. This diagram emphasizes the logical flow and decision-making process, reflecting the systemâ€™s role in automating and maintaining the integrity of live digitization.

\subsection{Color Palette}

Voting revealed a mix of preferences: some participants favored the light mode from palette \#08 and the dark mode from palette \#07, while others selected the board design from palette \#05 or the move-highlighting style from palette \#14. \\

Rather than selecting a single predefined palette, the final color scheme was assembled by combining the most highly rated elements across the top-voted variationsâ€”yielding a more tailored, user-informed visual design. Figure \ref{fig:color-palette-results} shows the distribution of votes across all tested palettes; the full set of prototypes appears in Appendix \ref{app:color-palettes}.
