\section{Background}

Chess, one of the oldest and most revered strategy games, traces its origins to the Gupta dynasty in 6th-century India. Over the past 1,500 years, it has evolved into a global phenomenon, with competitive play spanning 172 countries worldwide \cite{artsnculture}. \\

Documenting and analyzing chess games played on traditional boards often requires manual effort or expensive digital chessboards, which come with cumbersome setup procedures. Aalesunds Schaklag envisions a cost-effective and user-friendly solution to automate the digitization of chess games.  The system will enable players to enjoy uninterrupted gameplay \gls{otb} while capturing and processing their moves in real-time. This will simplify game documentation and provide players with analysis capabilities, such as integration with tools such as \gls{stockfish}.

\section{Objective}

The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application that digitizes chess games played on a traditional board. It will use image recognition technologies and a webcam to capture and interpret gameplay in real time. This solution aims to replicate the functionality of expensive digital chessboards in a more affordable and accessible manner.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automatic Digitization:} The application will generate \gls{pgn} files from the captured gameplay, enabling efficient documentation and archival of chess games.

    \item \textbf{Real-Time Visualization:} A digital chessboard will be displayed within the application, updating dynamically to reflect the moves detected by the webcam.

    \item \textbf{Local Execution:} All processing will be done locally on the user’s device,
    ensuring privacy and improved performance without reliance on external
    services.
\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements}

The solution will be implemented as a local application compatible with machines running Windows or Ubuntu operating systems. The application will utilize a webcam to detect the chessboard, pieces, and moves in real-time. All processing, including image recognition and move validation, will occur locally on the user's machine.

\section{Equipment}
The following equipment was used throughout the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 cameras
    \item One wooden chessboard
    \item One plastic chessboard
    \item One USB hub
    \item Staunton-style chess piece sets
\end{itemize}
