\section{Background}

Chess, one of the oldest and most revered strategy games, traces its origins to the Gupta dynasty in 6th-century India. Over the past 1,500 years, it has evolved into a global phenomenon, with competitive play spanning 172 countries worldwide \cite{artsnculture}. \

Documenting and analyzing chess games played on traditional boards often requires manual effort or expensive digital chessboards, which come with cumbersome setup procedures. Aalesunds Schaklag envisions a cost-effective and user-friendly solution to automate the digitization of chess games.  The system will enable players to enjoy uninterrupted gameplay on a traditional chessboard while capturing and processing their moves in real-time. This will simplify game documentation and provide players with advanced analysis capabilities, such as integration with tools like \gls{stockfish}.

\section{Objective}

The primary objective of this project is to develop a desktop application capable of digitizing chess games played on a traditional board. Using image recognition technologies, the application will capture and interpret gameplay in real-time via a standard webcam connected to the user's machine. It will generate \gls{pgn} files for efficient documentation and archival of chess games, while also providing real-time visualization through a digital chessboard that dynamically updates to reflect detected moves. This solution aims to replicate the functionality of expensive digital chessboards in a more cost-effective and accessible manner.

\section{Requirements}

The solution will be implemented as a local application compatible with machines running Windows or Ubuntu operating systems. The application will utilize a standard webcam to detect the chessboard, pieces, and moves in real-time. All processing, including image recognition and move validation, will occur locally on the user's machine. Additionally, the application will generate \gls{pgn} files for documenting games and \gls{fen} strings for integration with the \gls{stockfish} \gls{api} for move analysis.
