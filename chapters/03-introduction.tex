\section{Background}

Chess, one of the oldest and most revered strategy games, traces its origins to the Gupta dynasty in 6th-century India. Over the past 1,500 years, it has evolved into a global phenomenon, with competitive play spanning 172 countries worldwide \cite{artsnculture}. \\

Documenting and analyzing chess games played on traditional boards often requires manual effort or expensive digital chessboards, which come with cumbersome setup procedures. Aalesunds Schaklag envisions a cost-effective and user-friendly solution to automate the digitization of chess games.  The system will enable players to enjoy uninterrupted gameplay \gls{otb} while capturing and processing their moves in real-time. This will simplify game documentation and provide players with analysis capabilities, such as integration with tools such as \gls{stockfish}.

\section{Motivation}

The team has chosen to work on the project \textbf{Live Digitization of Chess Games}, as it uniquely combines our shared interests in both chess and technology. All group members have experience with chess, whether as a hobby or through active involvement in chess communities. \\

We are particularly interested in exploring image recognition and machine learning technologies. Several of us have taken courses in machine learning and data processing, providing us with a solid foundation in the techniques required to analyze and interpret visual data in real-time. Developing a system capable of digitizing moves from a physical chessboard presents an exciting technical challenge and an excellent opportunity to apply our academic knowledge in a practical and meaningful way.

\section{Objective}

The objective of this project is to develop a desktop application that digitizes chess games played on a traditional board. It will use image recognition technologies and a webcam to capture and interpret gameplay in real time. To achieve this, the application will generate \gls{pgn} files, which are essential for archiving and analyzing games. The application will also provide real-time visualization through a digital chessboard that dynamically updates to reflect detected moves. This solution aims to replicate the functionality of expensive digital chessboards in a more affordable and accessible manner.


\section{Requirements}

The solution will be implemented as a local application compatible with machines running Windows or Ubuntu operating systems. The application will utilize a webcam to detect the chessboard, pieces, and moves in real-time. All processing, including image recognition and move validation, will occur locally on the user's machine.

\section{Equipment}
The following equipment was used throughout the project:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920 cameras
    \item One wooden chessboard
    \item One plastic chessboard
    \item One USB hub
    \item Staunton-style chess piece sets
\end{itemize}
