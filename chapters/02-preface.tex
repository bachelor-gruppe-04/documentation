This thesis marks the culmination of our bachelor's degree in Computer Science at NTNU Ã…lesund, completed during the spring semester of 2025. The project has allowed us to apply our theoretical knowledge to a real-world problem, deepening our understanding of machine learning, software development, and agile workflows. We are grateful for the opportunity to work on a project that combines our interests in chess and software development. \\

We would like to extend our gratitude to our supervisor, \textbf{\saleh}, for his guidance and insightful feedback throughout the duration of this project. We are also thankful to the product owner, \textbf{\arne}, for providing us with the opportunity to undertake this project and for his constructive feedback. Additionally, we would like to acknowledge the external assistance provided by \textbf{\peter}, who supplied the trained model and offered insightful guidance on its structure and practical application.
