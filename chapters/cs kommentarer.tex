%A well-defined code review process is essential for maintaining high code quality and preventing unstable or faulty code from reaching production. By incorporating code reviews into the team's workflow, software development teams can foster continuous improvement, ensure that all code is reviewed by multiple perspectives, and reduce the risk of introducing defects into the codebase \cite{gitlab:code-review}. \\

%By identifying and addressing bugs early in the development cycle, unit testing significantly enhances code quality and reduces the cost of fixing issues later in the process. It is a core practice in \gls{tdd}, where tests are written before the actual code, promoting a disciplined approach to development and ensuring that the code meets its requirements from the outset \cite{geeksforgeeks:unit-test}. \\

%Unit testing also contributes to the maintainability and scalability of a software system. Well-tested units are easier to refactor, extend, and integrate into larger systems, as their behavior is clearly defined and verified. Additionally, unit tests serve as living documentation, providing insights into how individual components are intended to function.

%The ultimate goal of usability testing is to identify pain points in the user experience and uncover opportunities for improvement. By understanding how users interact with the product and where they encounter challenges, developers can make informed decisions to refine the design, improve functionality, and increase overall user satisfaction \cite{geeksforgeeks:user-test}.

%In summary, type safety is a critical aspect of code quality, offering significant benefits in terms of reliability, collaboration, and debugging efficiency. Its implementation, whether through statically typed languages or tools like TypeScript, plays a vital role in modern software development practices \cite{dev:type-safety}.

%Jeg fjernet kapittelet 5.2.2 "Analyze chess games" i diskusjon ettersom jeg tror det ikke hadde vært verdt å legge til slik funksjonalitet når man har så mye funksjonalitet gjennom lichess sitt analyseverktøy.

%The reason for doing it this way, is that unlike detecting the 4 corners of the board directly, the algorithm can still run successfully even if various parts of the board are obscured. The question then becomes, how does it find the corners from these points?




%, indicating that the model is highly effective at correctly identifying chess pieces with minimal false positives and false negatives.

%These findings highlight the robustness of the ChessCam detection pipeline when evaluated on the original dataset and serve as a reliable upper-bound benchmark for subsequent comparisons

%This indicates that x-corner detection is more sensitive to variations in the input data and may require further tuning or training data augmentation to match the robustness of the piece detection model.
