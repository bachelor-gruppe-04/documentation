%A well-defined code review process is essential for maintaining high code quality and preventing unstable or faulty code from reaching production. By incorporating code reviews into the team's workflow, software development teams can foster continuous improvement, ensure that all code is reviewed by multiple perspectives, and reduce the risk of introducing defects into the codebase \cite{gitlab:code-review}. \\

%\subsubsection*{Cross-Platform}
%\label{subsubsec:corss-platform}
%Cross-platform applications are software programs designed to function consistently across multiple operating systems or platforms. This includes desktop environments such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile platforms like iOS and Android \cite{sevenpeaks:cross-platform}.

%By identifying and addressing bugs early in the development cycle, unit testing significantly enhances code quality and reduces the cost of fixing issues later in the process. It is a core practice in \gls{tdd}, where tests are written before the actual code, promoting a disciplined approach to development and ensuring that the code meets its requirements from the outset \cite{geeksforgeeks:unit-test}. \\

%Unit testing also contributes to the maintainability and scalability of a software system. Well-tested units are easier to refactor, extend, and integrate into larger systems, as their behavior is clearly defined and verified. Additionally, unit tests serve as living documentation, providing insights into how individual components are intended to function.

%The ultimate goal of usability testing is to identify pain points in the user experience and uncover opportunities for improvement. By understanding how users interact with the product and where they encounter challenges, developers can make informed decisions to refine the design, improve functionality, and increase overall user satisfaction \cite{geeksforgeeks:user-test}.

%In summary, type safety is a critical aspect of code quality, offering significant benefits in terms of reliability, collaboration, and debugging efficiency. Its implementation, whether through statically typed languages or tools like TypeScript, plays a vital role in modern software development practices \cite{dev:type-safety}.

%----Jeg fjernet det over fra 3.4 SoftWare Design ettersom jeg tenker det ikke er nødvendig å nevne det siden det ikke var noe ønske----
%The product owner expressed no particular preferences and allowed the team full

%----DISKUSJON----%

%Jeg fjernet kapittelet 5.2.2 "Analyze chess games" i diskusjon ettersom jeg tror det ikke hadde vært verdt å legge til slik funksjonalitet når man har så mye funksjonalitet gjennom lichess sitt analyseverktøy.
