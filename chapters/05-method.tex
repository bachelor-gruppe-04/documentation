\section{Software Design}
\label{sec:software-design}

Regarding the design of the product, the product owner expressed no particular preferences and allowed the group full control in determining the website’s structure and color palette. 

\subsection{Design Process}
\label{subsec:design-process}

\subsubsection*{User-Centered Design}
\label{subsubsec:user-centered-design}

This process aligns with the principles discussed in \ref{subsubsec:usability-testing}, as outlined in Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}. \\

At the beginning of the design process, the group conducted wireframe testing with a diverse set of users. This included participants of varying age groups—from young to elderly—as well as both chess players and non-chess players. The goal was to evaluate whether users found the interface intuitive and whether the sizing and layout were appropriate across different demographics. \\

All participants were given the same context before starting the test: 

\begin{quote}
\textit{You are viewing a chess game between two companions you know. You visit the tournament organizer's website and come across this webpage.}
\end{quote}

Participants were then either given specific tasks to perform within the application or asked to explore freely, mimicking a real-world scenario. This approach aimed to identify how naturally users could navigate and understand the application without explicit instruction. \\

After completing their interaction with the application, participants filled out an anonymous feedback form. This encouraged honest, unfiltered responses, reducing the likelihood of social desirability bias. The form included questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the overall experience of the application?}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the Tournament View page?}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the Board View page?}
    \item \textit{Do you have any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or features you would like to see added?}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Color Palette}
\label{subsubsec:color-palette}

When selecting the color palette for the application, the group opted for a variation of blue. This choice was influenced by the symbolic associations of the color blue, which is often linked to imagination, intelligence, and wisdom \cite{blue}—qualities that closely reflect the essence of chess \cite{chess:ppqty, chess:chess-and-creativity}. \\

To determine the most suitable variation, multiple versions of the application were created, each featuring a different color palette. These variations were printed and displayed on a wall, allowing candidates from diverse backgrounds to view and compare them. \\

Participants were then asked to vote for their preferred version using a form. The variation that received the highest number of votes was ultimately chosen as the final color palette for the application. \\

\begin{axis}[
	x tick label style={
		/pgf/number format/1000 sep=},
	ylabel=Number of Votes,
	enlargelimits=0.05,
	legend style={at={(0.5,-0.1)},
	anchor=north,legend columns=-1},
	ybar interval=0.7
]
\addplot 
	coordinates {(1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (10, 4) (11, 3) (12, 2) (13, 7) (14, 10) (15, 0)};
