\subsection{Design Process}
\label{subsec:design-process}

\subsubsection*{User-Centered Design}
\label{subsubsec:user-centered-design}

At the beginning of the design process, the group conducted wireframe testing with a diverse set of users. This included participants of varying age groups—from young to elderly—as well as both chess players and non-chess players. The goal was to evaluate whether users found the interface intuitive and whether the sizing and layout were appropriate across different demographics. \\

All participants were given the same context before starting the test: 

\begin{quote}
\textit{You are viewing a chess game between two companions you know. You visit the tournament organizer's website and come across this webpage.}
\end{quote}

Participants were then either given specific tasks to perform within the application or asked to explore freely, mimicking a real-world scenario. This approach aimed to identify how naturally users could navigate and understand the application without explicit instruction. \\

After completing their interaction with the application, participants filled out an anonymous feedback form. This encouraged honest, unfiltered responses, reducing the likelihood of social desirability bias. The form included questions such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the overall experience of the application?}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the Tournament View page?}
    \item \textit{On a scale from 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the Board View page?}
    \item \textit{Do you have any feedback, suggestions for improvement, or features you would like to see added?}
\end{itemize}

This process aligns with the principles discussed in \ref{subsubsec:usability-testing}, as outlined in Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}.
