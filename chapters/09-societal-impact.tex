\section{Professional Ethics and Reflections}
The use of real-time video input introduces important ethical considerations related to data collection and privacy. While the system relies on live camera feeds to detect chess moves, no video data is stored or archived. All image processing takes place locally and in real time, ensuring that no identifiable information is retained beyond the moment of inference. \\

This application is collecting only the data strictly necessary for functionality, not storing sensitive data, and ensuring transparency about how data is used. Additionally, the application requires no user authentication or external communication, further reducing the risk of unauthorized data access or misuse. \\

All testing during development was carried out anonymously and was voluntary. No information about test participants was recorded or linked to personal identities, and the chess games used for evaluation were not associated with individual players. \\
