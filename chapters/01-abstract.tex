This project aimed to design and implement a solution for a cheaper and more accessible way for managing chess notations during live games for Aalesund Shacklag. The objective was to create a solution that utilizes a webcam to analyze chess pieces and their positions, whilst generating \gls{pgn} and \gls{fen} files.\\

Using \Gls{agile} methodologies for project management, the system was developed using technologies such as \Gls{python} and \gls{leyolo}.
