\subsection{Agenda}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using perspective transformation to find edges of chess board
    \item Our meeting with Arne Unneland
    \item Explanation of math in documentation
\end{itemize}

Recap of Arne meeting. Next meeting after INGA exam. Is he happy about of the result. He shared some tips, like websockets. Diplay updates on chess games live. 

Camera connected to the internet (IB camera). Using IP adress. then the website does not need access to the camera. So why use websocket? He dont want it to steam? Thats easier. Supervisor does not think its nessecary to use websockets. 

On display application have video, a digital board and the PGN to show previous moves. Kanny detector?
