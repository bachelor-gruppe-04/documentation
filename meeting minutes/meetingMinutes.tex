\chapter{Meeting Minutes}
Effective documentation of meeting minutes is critical to ensure smooth collaboration, accountability, and progress tracking during the development of our bachelor's thesis project. This chapter outlines the structure and practices for recording minutes for three types of meetings: group meetings, meetings with the supervisor, and meetings with the product owner.

\section*{Group Meetings}
Group meetings are essential to align the efforts of all team members, discuss progress, and address challenges. These meetings are typically held weekly and are structured to maximize productivity and ensure that all members are updated.

\section*{Meetings with the Supervisor}
Meetings with the supervisor are held to ensure that the project progresses according to academic expectations and to seek guidance on technical or organizational challenges. These meetings are scheduled periodically, often aligning with major milestones in the project.

\section*{Meetings with the Product Owner}
The product owner meetings are integral in aligning project outcomes with stakeholders' expectations. These meetings focus on requirements, feedback on deliverables, and ensuring that the project adheres to the intended vision.
