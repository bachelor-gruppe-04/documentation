\textbf{Reflection on meeting with Arne}
Arne invited to meeting at his office. Not decided date yet. \\

\textbf{How is it going}
Finished documentation and researched how to implement. Picked up equipment, such as camera and chess board and pieces. Use other resources, how do they work? Read the previous groups report. Divide the process. Camera, detect objects, find pieces. Light/shadows remove. \\

Don't recognize the pieces for top angle. Far away, two boards at a time. \\

\textbf{Next} 
Look at previous work. How to detect pieces. What have the other done. Start on the algorithm. Retrain models for other dataset. Understand the problem. Use python. The process as whole. Then think about existing models and retrain them.
