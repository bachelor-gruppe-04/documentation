The group held an initial meeting to plan the Bachelor thesis project. This included contacting the supervisor via email to arrange an initial meeting. After consideration, the group decided to meet with the supervisor before the product owner to gain insights into the overall process and expectations. The group has been working on project documentation and structure and has conducted preliminary research related to the thesis topic. The ideas and findings will be discussed further with the supervisor and the product owner to refine the direction of the project.
