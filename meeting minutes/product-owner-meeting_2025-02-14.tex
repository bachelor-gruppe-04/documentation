\subsection{Agenda}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Selection of Language and Tools
    \item Functionality of the application
    \item Design of the application
    \item Plan the next meeting
\end{itemize}

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of developing a full Python application using a chess library compared to other alternatives. Consider  using Electron with Vite and React, given the group's prior experience from the web development course. Based on discussions with the Supervisor, the recommendation is to use languages and tools based on prior experience.

Determine how the application should be designed. For a tournament setting, it is necessary to display the game board. Additionally, game analysis may be a useful functionality. This would be needing an internet connection due to API usage. Should the application support multiple views, such as a "Display View" for gameplay and an "Analysis View" for post-game evaluation?

Schedule the date and time for the next meeting.
