\end{itemize}

What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing a full Python application with a chess library compared to using JavaScript, which also offers a library?

How should the application be designed? For a tournament, there is a need to display the game board. However, there may also be a requirement for game analysis, which would necessitate an internet connection due to the use of an API. Should the application feature multiple views, such as a "Display View" and an "Analysis View"?

Schedule the date and time for the next meeting.
