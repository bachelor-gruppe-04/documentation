What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing a full Python application with a chess library compared to using JavaScript, which also offers a library?

What should we focus on moving forward?

The supervisor need to review and approve the documentation that has been submitted on Blackboard. This includes the pre-project plan, work contract and standard agreement.  

The current meeting time, Fridays at 10 PM, conflicts with our schedule. Would it be possible to reschedule to Fridays at 12 PM?
