What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing a full Python application with a chess library compared to using JavaScript, which also offers a library? The product owner has not specified. Python is best for machinelearning. python is fine. Not difficult to learing. fine for both by performance. 

What should we focus on moving forward? Should be able to download the data, is up to the product owner. May be some issues with privacy. This needs to be discussed with the product owner. Can we improve the model? not major differences. Good to understand the basics of the model. Which method has been used. Show that we understand. Retraining is timeconsuming. read the clock and add it to the display for further improvement. Focus on whats useful for the Schaklag. Multiple games? More wanted a solution so they dont need to come back. Not diffictult for a normal user to use.
