\textbf{Project Title} Live Digitalization of Chess Games\\\\
\textbf{Problem Statement} Digitalization of chess games based on camera input.

\section*{Project Description}
The goal of the project is to develop a solution where chess games played on a standard chessboard can be automatically digitized into PGN files. These files should be made available either as an API or as events in a queue. The solution requires:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Image recognition of the chessboard and pieces.
    \item Live validation against chess rules to ensure correct moves are registered.
    \item Local installation on hardware, using a typical mix of USB-connected webcams and a local machine (Windows or Ubuntu) for all processing. No cloud processing is allowed.
\end{itemize}

Existing digital chessboards perform similar tasks but are expensive and require significant setup time. This project aims to automate this process more cost-effectively.

\section*{Additional Comments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The software must be installable on local hardware and function independently without cloud processing.
    \item Open-source software is preferred for all components.
    \item Development can take place at the club premises where necessary hardware (computers, cameras, chess equipment) is available.
    \item The software created must be published in a public Git repository without restrictions for future use or modifications.
\end{itemize}
